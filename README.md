# README for Sentence Similarity Script

## Overview

This script calculates the cosine similarity between pairs of sentences read from a text file, leveraging embeddings to represent the sentences numerically. It uses these embeddings to compute the similarity and sorts the pairs by their similarity score in descending order. The result is a Pandas DataFrame showcasing the top pairs with the highest similarity scores.

## How It Works

The script operates in several key steps:

1. **Loading Sentences**: Sentences are loaded from a text file into a list, where each line in the file represents a distinct sentence.
2. **Generating Embeddings**: For each sentence, an embedding is generated, creating a numerical representation of the sentence. This step assumes the existence of a `getEmbeddingsAsDictionary` function that maps each sentence to its corresponding embedding and returns a dictionary where the keys are the sentences and the values are their embeddings.
3. **Comparing Sentences**: The script iterates through pairs of sentences, calculating the cosine similarity between their embeddings. These similarities are stored along with the sentence pairs in a list of dictionaries.
4. **Sorting and Displaying Results**: The list of dictionaries is converted into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis. The DataFrame is sorted by similarity in descending order to prioritize the most similar sentence pairs. Finally, the script prints the top results, providing insights into which sentences are most similar to each other.

## Key Components

- `loadSentencesFromFile()`: Function to load sentences from a text file. Each line in the file is considered a separate sentence.
- `getEmbeddingsAsDictionary(sentences)`: Function that takes a list of sentences and returns a dictionary mapping each sentence to its embedding.
- `compare(result)`: Function that takes the result of `getEmbeddingsAsDictionary` and computes the cosine similarity between all pairs of sentences, returning a sorted DataFrame with the results.

## Usage

To use this script, ensure you have a text file with sentences you wish to compare. The file should contain one sentence per line. Then, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the environment by installing the required packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, and any specific library needed for calculating embeddings and cosine similarity.
2. Place your sentences text file in a known directory.
3. Ensure you have defined or have access to the `loadSentencesFromFile` and `getEmbeddingsAsDictionary` functions, as they are essential for the script's operation.
4. Run the script. The top similar sentence pairs will be printed to the console.

## Example Output

The output will be a Pandas DataFrame printed to the console, showing the top pairs of sentences with their similarity scores, sorted in descending order.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Libraries for computing embeddings and cosine similarity (e.g., scikit-learn for cosine similarity)
- sentence_transformers

Ensure all dependencies are installed using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn sentence_transformers
```

## Final Note

This script is a powerful tool for analyzing the similarity between sentences, useful in various natural language processing tasks. Customize it according to your specific requirements by modifying the embedding generation process or adjusting the similarity threshold as needed.
