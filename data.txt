The cat sleeps on the sofa.
A dog sleeps under the table.
The cat rests on the couch.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
Eating an apple daily can improve your health.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A fast fox leaps over a lazy dog.
I love reading books in the library.
Reading books is my favorite hobby
The sun rises in the east.
The sun sets in the west.
